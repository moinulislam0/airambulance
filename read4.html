                    Air ambulance in Dhaka is an invaluable service that can help save the lives of those who need
                    urgent medical care. Because Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, lacks proper medical facilities, it can
                    take hours or even days to transport patients to hospitals that can treat them. <br><br>

                    Air ambulances in Dhaka, on the other hand, can get patients to lifesaving treatment quickly, saving
                    them from injuries or ailments that could have killed them otherwise. <br><br>

                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-12">There are many things to consider when arranging emergency medical
                    transport. Here are some of the points that you should consider before deciding. <br><br>

                    Emergency medical transport is when a patient is transferred from one location to another in an
                    emergency. It can be done by ground, air, sea, or even private vehicles. <br><br>

                    Some of the primary considerations that should be made before arranging such an emergency medical
                    transport include:
                <ul class="list-disc mt-4 text-white ml-16">

                    <li>What is the patient’s condition?</li>
                    <li>How long will it take for them to recover? </li>
                    <li class="mt-4">Are they medically fit enough to travel, and what additional health conditions do
                        they have?</li>
                    <li class="mt-4">What would happen if they were not transported, and how would their condition
                        worsen?</li>
                    <li class="mt-4">Is there any risk of spreading infection or disease during transportation? </li>

                        href="https://www.quora.com/Can-air-ambulances-fly-at-night">Safety Concerns</a>, Some Air Ambulances Cannot Fly at Night.
                    Biman, one of two air ambulance service providers in Bangladesh and India, did not respond to
                    numerous requests seeking comment. So why can’t these night flights be made? <br><br>

                    The short answer is that it comes down to safety concerns for both patients and crew members
                    (although, as we’ll explore, there are some other possible factors as well).

                <p class="mt-4 text-white text-xl">In BD Night Flights: It’s too risky. An air ambulance service cannot
                    fly in the dark without outside
                    visual confirmation of the landing site. Furthermore, to do so would require as many as two pilots
                    with night flying experience. <br><br>

                    Finally, due to safety concerns with nighttime flights, night flights are capped at 1 hour in
                    Bangladesh, where pilots and crew members must be on a 24-hour shift schedule and have at least 20
                    hours of nighttime experience. </p>

                    hospitals. <br><br>

                    Since time is critical when treating medical emergencies, especially those with heart problems,
                    being able to fly doctors and paramedics directly to their destination can help save lives. When we
                    are injured, we call the ambulance service to go to the hospital, And when you need air service to

                    In Bangladesh, many companies are providing air ambulance services. Air Ambulance Bangladesh Ltd

                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4"> What is the Importance of Air Ambulances?
                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-4">There are many air ambulances services providers in the world. But, Bangladesh is
                    a developing country, and there are not any air ambulance service providers in Bangladesh. So, in an
                    emergency, people have to pay for their treatment from their pocket or government funds. <br><br>

                    As a result, patients lose their lives during traveling because of traffic jams, etc. Hence they
                    need to solve their problems as soon as possible through Air Ambulance services. These service
                    providers will help them treat them immediately at those places where medical facilities are only
                    available. <br><br>

                    Still, no doctors work at that hour so that they will be able to save patients’ lives by providing
                    specialized treatment or arranging better medical facilities, which are only available in the
                    capital city or central cities..

                </p>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4"> What is the Expense?
                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-4">Air ambulance services are, as you would expect, significantly more
                    expensive
                    than ground transport. Whether or not it’s worth it will depend on various factors, including
                    whether there is a dedicated air ambulance that can meet your needs and whether you’re stuck with
                    outpatient care following a hospital stay. <br><br>

                    If your employer is paying for part or all of your treatment, then cost probably isn’t much of an
                    issue—you can take comfort knowing that the bill will be footed by someone else. On average, air
                    ambulance trips cost about 80,000 to 3,50,000 BDT. The cost is time low or may be high, so before
                    booking the Service, call us and know the current price.

                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Why are Patients Transported by Air?
                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-4">Air ambulances are necessary, first and foremost, because they can
                    respond more quickly than ground ambulances. They are also used to transport patients over longer
                    distances and to places that lack adequate infrastructures, such as airfields and rural areas.
                    <br><br>

                    One of their most important uses is providing access to advanced trauma care, provided by
                    specialists who treat life-threatening injuries or illnesses. Air ambulance providers can have
                    full-time emergency rooms onboard, allowing doctors to stabilize a patient even while in flight.

                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4"> "What are Some Drawbacks to Utilizing Air Medical Transport?"
                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-4">Air medical transport is a lifesaving mode of transportation, but it
                    can be costly and inconvenient. Whether you’re paying out-of-pocket or using insurance, air
                    transport can cost anywhere from 80,000 to 3,15,000. Air ambulances usually have few
                    amenities—they’re loud and can travel only to certain destinations—and they may not accept patients
                    with preexisting conditions.

                    are part of commercial airlines and use those pilots and crew members during emergency flights. If a
                    patient’s situation is critical, some pilots have been known to fly at speeds above <a

                    both day and night. Certain helicopters have a service
                    called EMS (Emergency Medical Services), where a helicopter is used to transport medical staff or
                    patients during emergencies.

                    This Service mainly operates during the daytime, but some drive at night, depending on contracts
                    between services and their cities. In many cases, these helicopters will often fly while it is dark
                    if they need to get somewhere quickly due to an urgent situation.

                    It can be a matter of life and death. Air ambulances are specially equipped aircraft that fly
                    patients directly from one hospital to another. Air ambulances serve people with critical or urgent
                    conditions who need immediate care but can’t travel on conventional transportation by car or plane.

                    call, whether from their doctors or paramedics, at a hospital. Many of these services will have

                <p class="text-xl mt-4">If you live in Dhaka and an emergency strikes, you need a hospital with
                    emergency room facilities. In such situations, an air ambulance is your best bet to save your life
                    and get you treatment as soon as possible. <br><br>

                    several hospitals across Dhaka quickly, so you have a better chance of surviving any emergency. For
                    example, Air Ambulance Bangladesh Ltd offers air ambulances from Dhaka, which provides flight services
                    seven days a week.
