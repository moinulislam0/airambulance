                    <p class="text-justify mt-4 text-l">In the midst of the Second World War, as Britain's military
                        reached its peak and Germany questioned neutrality, Kurmitola emerged as one of the numerous
                        landing strips constructed to bolster their resistance against Fascism. This transformation
                        marked the evolution of the small town near the now-defunct Tejgaon airport, which preserves a
                        rich aviation history. Notably, BorInput played a pivotal role with a straightforward
                        objective—to enhance opportunities across diverse industries and sectors within the community.
                        Their commitment involves providing customers with tailored solutions that cater precisely to
                        their unique needs! <br><br>

                        The era where companies, regardless of their size, had to limit their exploration of services is
                        now past. We now grant you access to a network of top-notch professionals, each specializing in
                        a wide array of segments. <br><br>

                        In 1966, the then Pakistan Government initiated a project to construct a new airport, choosing
                        Kurmitola as its designated location. As a convenience for those residing in the proximity of
                        airports like Tejgaon or Nur Khan Jahan Abad, an additional railway station, known today as the
                        Airport Railway Station, was erected nearby. This strategic placement aimed to facilitate easy
                        access for passengers, allowing seamless transitions between destinations via train rides while
                        also ensuring proximity to their ultimate goals upon arrival at either endpoint. <br><br>



                        This story's origin traces back to the demands for autonomy by East Pakistani settlers within
                        what is now Bangladesh. These demands emerged after the UK's agreement during negotiations
                        related to the Indian partition plan on 15 August 1947. The ensuing tension prompted India to
                        impose a blockade.
                        <br><br>



                        Zia International Airport underwent a name change, being renamed after the highly esteemed Sufi
                        Saint, Shah Jalal. This renaming pays tribute to a remarkable individual and symbolizes
                        Bangladesh's declaration of independence from British rule in 1971. <br><br>

                        The project required an additional three years for completion, a period that encompassed the
                        assassination of President Ziaur Rahman, who subsequently re-inaugurated it as "Z." <br><br>

                        On December 6, 2011, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner (flight ZA006) made a refueling stop at Shahjalal
                        International Airport. This stop was part of an ambitious attempt to achieve a nonstop flight
                        covering 19,830 km from Seattle to Dhaka via India. Equipped with General Electric engines, this
                        aircraft surpassed its own world distance record set just the previous year when it covered
                        8,700 miles in a single flight.<br><br>

                    <p class="text-justify mt-4 text-l">The airport has been established and enhanced with technology
                        and instruments valued at ৳70 million (US$830,000) by the CAAB, which includes: <br><br>

                        -A multi-storey car park capable of accommodating 500 cars, constructed during a period of rapid
                        expansion in 1992. The facilities also feature instrumentation such as a boarding bridge for
                        aircraft and other essential equipment.<br><br>

                        The airport is actively implementing essential upgrades to enhance its operational efficiency.
                        The introduction of instruments like the instrument landing system, distance measuring
                        equipment, and flight calibration systems has significantly improved safety at this Chittagong
                        complex. Moreover, the installation of new boarding bridges has further increased efficiency.
                        Construction of a fourth runway has commenced under the supervision of one of Bangladesh's
                        leading companies, Abdul Monem Ltd., with an expected completion timeline of six months.
                        Notably, progress has been swift, with the initiation of an asphalt overlay in early December
                        2012, facilitated by funds totaling 53 million dollars from DANIDA. These funds support various
                        projects, including the construction of a radar, primary and secondary control towers, and
                        more.<br><br>

                        The airport is currently enhancing its parking infrastructure for both cargo and passenger
                        aircraft through a project valued at ৳440 million (US$5.2 million). The upgraded aprons are
                        designed to accommodate four wide-bodied planes in a single space, with the flexibility to
                        accommodate two smaller planes side by side or across from each other, depending on their size.
                        This strategic layout minimizes the walking distance when searching for an available parking
                        spot.<br><br>

                        The upgrade should be finished around 2021.<br><br>

                        CAAB has recently finished the modernization and enhancement of two terminal buildings, erected
                        five aircraft parking bays, and installed two additional boarding bridges to expedite the
                        boarding process for passengers. Additionally, they have reinstated the power plant, ensuring
                        uninterrupted 24-hour service without any issues.<br><br>

                        The CAA Bus Station Expansion Project was successfully completed in recent years, incorporating
                        numerous facilities such as passenger check-in counters and baggage conveyor belts to enhance
                        travelers' convenience.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify mt-4 text-l">On December 28th, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh
                        Hasina, initiated the construction of a new terminal at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.
                        This marks the third phase of an extensive project designed to enhance passenger experience and
                        facilitate increased air traffic in Asia's fourth-largest economy. The upcoming terminal, named
                        "Airport City," is anticipated to be completed within 18 months. The construction is led by the
                        Japanese consortium ADC, primarily composed of Mitsubishi Corporation and partners such as
                        Samsung C&T Corporation, with technical support from the Boeing Company. <br><br>

                        The third terminal of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport is scheduled to finish construction
                        by 2022. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has offered financial support through
                        loans for this project. This arrangement enables the loan recipient, Maldives’ Ministry Of
                        Finance, to allocate additional funds from its existing budget or reallocate them to other
                        prioritized projects, given that they have been pre-approved even before issuance, ensuring
                        flexibility and minimal risk.</p>

                        million passengers. Its construction is crucial for ensuring that Biman Airlines has sufficient

                    <p class="text-justify mt-4 text-l">A feasibility study was undertaken to assess the viability of
                        adding a runway, with an estimated cost of ৳10 billion (US$120 million). The primary goal of
                        this project is not only to enhance air traffic but also to alleviate the strain on the existing
                        single runway, thereby doubling the airport's capacity. Despite the airport already serving over
                        10 million passengers annually, more than 60% of the approximately 2000 acres designated for
                        construction in 2014 remained unused, comprising mainly grassland rather than developed areas.
                        This led to skepticism about the project's success, drawing comparisons to instances such as the
                        challenges faced by New York's LaGuardia Airport despite significant terminal upgrades earlier

                        A recent study reveals that travelers have diverse motivations for selecting particular
                        locations on Earth. Some crave peace and relaxation, while others are in pursuit of adventure
                        and thrill-seeking activities, such as bungee jumping off bridges at dawn before breakfast
                        begins.</p>

                        out or face potential skyrocketing prices. With the upcoming peak season in South Asia Travel
                        Pulse next week, demand is high, and both flight tickets and hotel rooms may become more
                        expensive. To avoid any inconvenience, especially during major events or religious holidays like
                        Christmas and New Year's Day, it's advisable to book early. If solo travel appeals to you,
                        consider going alone, but be sure to stay mindful of visa requirements, which can vary depending
                        on your passport's issuing country.</p>
