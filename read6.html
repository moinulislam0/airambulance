                    one of the most active airports in Asia. It has been consistently ranked as the busiest airport in
                    the world since 2009. Dhaka Airport is served by three main international airlines, namely Thai
                    Airways International Ltd., Malaysia Airlines Berhad, and Bahrain Air Company BSC. Dhaka Airport
                    also serves flights from many other countries with connections to Dhaka via their own national
                    airlines or connecting carriers. Dhaka is a few hours away from Bangkok, Thailand, so it’s possible
                    for you to book an air ambulance transportation service that will take you there if necessary

                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-12">Airlifting a patient is expensive. The cost of an airlift can range
                    from $5,000 to over 10 thousand dollars depending on where you live and what kind of aircraft it is
                    that flies them into their destination hospital or clinic location. <br><br>

                    For example, cargo jets typically charge between 9500-12500 USD, while military helicopters usually
                    go for about 5k -7K plus fuel costs which may total up to 15%.

                    where it takes place, what type of aircraft they use, and how many people need to be transported.
                    <br><br>

                    The average private jet can carry four passengers or more depending on whether you choose economy or
                    business class seats that cost less per person but offer better service with snacks included in your
                    ticket price! This means that when purchasing tickets through companies such as NetJets™ Corporation
                    – whose headquarters are located at Teterboro Airport north-west New Jersey- fees range anywhere

                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-12">How many patients can an air ambulance carry? It depends on the type
                    of aircraft and what they’re transporting. For example, most helicopters have room for two, but some
                    airplanes will only accommodate one person at a time; when that happens, our crew works with local
                    authorities or family members to make sure everyone gets where they need to go safely!

                    going and how long it will take. However, these days international trips tend not to be inexpensive
                    due to safety concerns with the plane itself as well as other factors such as Airlines policies

                    said travels through different parts of the country; however, this situation does happen from

                    want to be answered with an answer that doesn’t involve traffic and usually not too many hours on

                    another option: the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). EMS does take some time getting used to – it
                    is different from driving your car because instead of following one route like normal roads or
                    highways, every exit has been planned ahead, As well as incoming directions based on these exits;

                </h1>
                <p class="text-white text-xl mt-12">What type of aircraft does an air ambulance use? The most common
                    types include helicopters and fixed-wing planes. Helicopters can be used for medical relief
                    missions. Whereas airplanes have more room to store equipment on board. Including stretchers means
                    they are often better suited when there’s not enough space with ground ambulances available at the
                    emergency scene. Situated near downtown DHAKA, many private hospitals employ this form, usually due
                    to its quick access times; however, some cases may require travel further away before getting into
                    safer surroundings. <br><br>
